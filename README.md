## About
This is a multi-threaded TCP server, written in C, along with clients
for Windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS

This server listens for connections and replies back with how much time
is left based on the date provided in its config file.

**NOTE:** The server is only designed to run on Unix-based machines. 
It will not work on Windows unless you run it with Docker.

________________
## Building And Deploying The Server With Docker
You can build and deploy this server with Docker. To build the Docker 
image use the provided <code>Dockerfile</code>.
```bash
docker build -t time-remaining .
```

Once you build the Docker image you can run it with the following 
command:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8989:8989 time-remaining
```

Or, preferably, run it with Docker-compose.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
________________
## Config Files
Example client- and server-side configs are included in the 
<code>configs/</code> directory. In the case of the client, 
the config file tells the client where to connect to the server and what 
the reason for the countdown is for. The date and time of the event are
specified in the server configuration.

> **Note**:
> The hours in the server's configmust be 24 hour-based, not 
> 12 hour-based.

________________
## Building from Source
You have the ability to build both the client and the server from 
source with the provided makefile

### Clients
To build your respective client from source, simply run the following
command:
```bash
make client
```
This will build either the Windows or Unix client based on your OS.

**NOTE:** For Windows users, the provided makefile is designed for 
Windows operating systems with MSYS2 installed and configured. A guide 
on how to do that can be found on their website 
<a href="https://www.msys2.org" target="new">here</a>

#### iOS
For installing the app on your iPhone, view the 
[iOS App README](clients/iOS/README.md)

### Server
As mentioned in the [about](#about) section, this server is only made for
Unix-based operating systems, **NOT** Windows. If you try to build the 
server on Windows via the makefile, it will not work. For Unix systems,
you can build the server via the following command:
```bash
make
```
