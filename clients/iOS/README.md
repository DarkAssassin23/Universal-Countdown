# Universal Countdown iOS App

## About
iOS Client for Universal Countdown

## iOS Device Requirements
  * iOS 16 or newer

## Installation
To install the app on your iPhone, you will need a Mac with Xcode 
Version 14 or newer installed on it.

### Enable Developer Mode
Seeing that this app is not on the App Store and you need to install 
it manually, you need to enable developer mode on your iPhone. To do
this, go to <code>Settings</code> -> <code>Privacy & Security</code>. 
Scroll down to the bottom, select <code>Developer Mode</code>, and 
toggle it on. After you do so, Settings presents an alert to warn you 
that Developer Mode reduces the security of your device. To continue 
enabling Developer Mode, tap the alert's Restart button.

### Trusting Your Developer License
Again, since this app is not on the App Store and you have to manually 
install it onto your iPhone, you will most likely encounter an error 
from Xcode trying to install it on your phone saying it was unable to 
launch the app because it has an invalid code signature. 

You will also see a similiar message on your iPhone saying "Untrusted 
Developer" and "Your device management settings do not allow using 
apps from developer <Your Developer Email/ID> on this iPhone." To fix 
this, go to <code>Settings</code> -> <code>General</code> -> 
<code>VPN & Device Management</code>. From here, tap the Developer App
and then trust it on the next page. Then re-build the app to your 
phone.

## Configuration
To configure your client, select the settings icon at the bottom of the
screen and enter the IP and port of your server. Optionally, you can 
set the occasion too. Finally, hit <code>Save</code> to save your 
changes.
